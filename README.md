***General info:***

This small proof of concept database built in MongoDB contains a selection of the 23/24 snowboards created by Ride
Snowboards, a snowboard company located in Washington state. The database
includes useful info to riders like board name, lengths, camber, and more.
To build and insert data into the Ride Snowboards database, run the statements in the
“build_final_db” file. To run queries against that database use the queries found in the
“query_final_db” file. Lastly, to connect and search the data from python take a look at
the “py_final_db” file.

***Why MongoDB:***

MongoDB was chosen for my database because of it’s flexibility. Since this database is
document based it can handle many varying attributes, which is perfect to the varying
kinds of specs and data for snowboards. It’s versatility and lack of relationships
between the data makes it an easy choice for seamless data entry of the snowboards.
